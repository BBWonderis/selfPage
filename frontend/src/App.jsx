            <p>
              I am a computer science student at the Faculty of Informatics,
              Masaryk University in Brno, currently looking for my first
              internship or junior position. I‚Äôm passionate about frontend
              development, especially working with React, and I enjoy building
              clean, responsive user interfaces. While frontend is my main
              focus, I‚Äôm also curious to explore backend development and expand
              my skills full-stack. I'm a goal-oriented person who loves
              learning new things, solving logical problems, and constantly
              improving. Programming excites me because it‚Äôs both creative and
              analytical. Although I don‚Äôt have professional experience yet,
              I‚Äôve worked on personal projects and I‚Äôm always experimenting to
              grow my skills. One of my challenges is that I sometimes
              underestimate my knowledge ‚Äî but I‚Äôm working on gaining confidence
              by building more, collaborating, and learning from others.
